## Task
I am predicting the parameters Para-9, Para-10, Para-11, Para-12, and Para-13 for year 10 from a 10-year dataset from an IoT sensor on the road.

## Model Used
I have used Light Gradient Boosting Machine for solving this problem.
LightGBM is a gradient boosting framework based on decision trees to increases the efficiency of the model and reduces memory usage. 
It uses two novel techniques: Gradient-based One Side Sampling and Exclusive Feature Bundling (EFB)

## Results
The RMSE value of the model is 67.7831.

## Note
I changed the dataset as 1 row was missing in section number 92. I created a row and added it to the dataset for uniformity.
